**Modeling Genetic By Environmental Interactions**. 

In the course we have focused on models for a single trait/environment. These models can be extended for the analysis of multiple-traits 
as well as for analysis of multi-environment data. This is described in [Lopez-Cruz et al. (2015)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25660166). 

The following entry in the BGLR webpage also provides information about the model [link](https://github.com/gdlc/BGLR-R/blob/master/inst/md/GxE_usingInteractions.md).


*Objectives*: Compare stratified analyses and interaction model based on:

  - Within-environment estimated genomic heritability
  - DIC/ pD (see `fm$fit\` in BGLR)
  - Within-environment prediction accuracy

*Data*: Wehat data set in BGLR (environments 1-3)

**Modeling Genetic Heterogneity using Interactions**

In the models covered in the course we have assumed that the regression of phenotypes on markers is homogeneous across subjects.

Human, plant and animal genomes usually cluster into groups that reflect the eselction/migration history of the population. This can lead
to heterogeneous effects. Effect heterogeneity can be accounted for using interactions. This is described in [de los Campos et al. (2015)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13253-015-0222-5). 

The following entry in the BGLR webpage also provides information about the model [link](https://github.com/gdlc/BGLR-R/blob/master/inst/md/heterogeneity_interactions.md).

*Objectives*:  Compare stratified analyses and interaction model based on:
