## Final Project 

**Presentation Format**

	- Duration: 12 minutes + 3 minutes for 1 or 2 questions (this follows standard scientific meeting format).
	- To achieve the above goal consider having 12 or less slides.
	- Focus on minimizing the slides so that you do not provide information that is not central and you do not need to rush when presenting.
	- Do not cut and paste text or formulas from other sources
	- Provide references, including reference to the software used or the origin of the data or methods used.
	- Sends your slides the morning of the day you are presenting (see table below).

**Suggested Structure ** (suggested #of slides)

	- Background for the problem. Why are we interested on this? (2)
	- Research question  (1)
	- Data (1)
	- Methods, be brief and minimize equations (1)
	- Results (2-4)
	- Conclusions (1)
